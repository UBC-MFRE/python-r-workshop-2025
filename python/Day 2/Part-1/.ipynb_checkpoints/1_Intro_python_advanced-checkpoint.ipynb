    "## Object Oriented Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\", which can contain data, in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods). For example, a car is an object which has certain properties such as color, model, and certain methods such as drive, stop, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classes and Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "A class is a blueprint for the object. We can think of class as a sketch (prototype) of a house. It contains all the details about the floors, doors, windows etc. Based on these descriptions we build the house. House is the object. When we create an object of a class, we are creating an instance of the class. This process is known as instantiation."

    "### Important Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Inheritance\n",
    "    - Inheritance is a way of creating a new class for using details of an existing class without modifying it. The newly formed class is a derived class (or child class). Similarly, the existing class is a base class (or parent class). \n",
    "2. Encapsulation\n",
    "    - Encapsulation is an another mechanism to restrict direct access to some of the object's components. Encapsulation is implemented by using access specifiers. An access specifier defines the scope and visibility of a class member.\n",
    "3. Polymorphism\n",
    "    - Polymorphism is an ability (in OOP) to use a common interface for multiple forms (data types). It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.\n",
    "4. Abstraction\n",
    "    - Abstraction is the concept of object-oriented programming that \"shows\" only essential attributes and \"hides\" unnecessary information. The main purpose of abstraction is hiding the unnecessary details from the users."

    "### Benefits of Object Oriented Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Modularity for easier troubleshooting**\n",
    "    - Something has gone wrong, and you have no idea where to look. Is the problem in the Widget, or is it the Wodget? If objects are well defined, you can more easily narrow down the problem to a particular object.\n",
    "2. **Reuse of code through inheritance**\n",
    "    - If an object already exists (perhaps written by someone else in your company), you can use that object in your program. And, if you have an object that almost does what you want but just needs a little extra functionality, you can create a new object based on the existing object.\n",
    "3. **Flexibility through polymorphism**\n",
    "    - If you have a bunch of objects that are all of the same class, but you want to iterate over them and call a particular method for each, polymorphism allows you to treat objects of different classes the same way if they contain a particular method.\n",
    "4. **Interface Descriptions**\n",
    "    - Objects can be described by the interfaces they support. If an object says it supports a particular interface, it means that the object has certain methods and properties. If an object says it supports a particular interface, it means that the object has certain methods and properties.\n",

We can also use libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to handle data more efficiently.\n",

    "    - A set is a collection which is unordered and unindexed. In Python sets are written with curly brackets.\n",
    "4. Dictionaries\n",
    "    - A dictionary is a collection which is unordered, changeable and indexed. In Python dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and they have keys and values.\n",
    "\n",
    "In my personal experience, you're going to be using lists and dictionaries the most. Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable. Dictionaries are used to store key-value pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "You would use a list when you have a collection of items that you want to keep in order. For example, you might use a list to store the names of all the students in a class. You would use a dictionary when you have a collection of items that you want to access by a unique key. For example, you might use a dictionary to store the email addresses of all the students in a class, with the student names as the keys.\n",

    "You can nest lists and dictionaries inside each other to create more complex data structures. For example, you might use a list of dictionaries to store information about a collection of students, with each dictionary representing a student. You can similarly nest lists within dictionaries and lists within lists and dictionaries within dictionaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may be tempted to always use dictionaries as they are more flexible than lists, but remember that lists are more efficient for storing ordered collections of items. As a rule of thumb, use lists when you need to keep items in order, and use dictionaries when you need to access items by a unique key.\n",
    "\n",
    "One reason you may want to use a list over a dictionary is if you need to access items by their index. Lists are ordered collections, so you can access items by their index. Dictionaries are unordered collections, so you can't access items by their index.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way you can use a dictionary to store items in order is to use a dictionary with integer keys. For example, you could use a dictionary with integer keys to store the names of all the students in a class, with the student names as the values and the student IDs as the keys. This way, you can access the student names by their student IDs. This way you can take advantage of the flexibility of dictionaries while still keeping items in order to enable indexing.

When you multiply two matrices, the number of columns in the first matrix must be equal to the number of rows in the second matrix. The resulting matrix will have the same number of rows as the first matrix and the same number of columns as the second matrix. The elements of the resulting matrix are calculated by taking the dot product of the corresponding rows and columns of the two matrices. This is reffered to as the dot product.\n",

You can use the `head()` method to view the first few rows of a DataFrame. You can use the `tail()` method to view the last few rows of a DataFrame. You can use the `info()` method to view information about a DataFrame, including the data types of each column and the number of non-null values in each column. You can use the `describe()` method to view summary statistics about a DataFrame, including the mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and quartiles of each column.\n",

In a `.py` or `.ipynb` file, you can import functions from other files using the `import` statement or the `from ... import ...` statement. You can also use the `as` keyword to give an imported module or function an alias. To import all functions from a module, you can use the `*` wildcard.\n",

    "Code segmentation is especially useful when working with a large codebase, as it allows you to organize your code into different files (modules). You can create a separate file for each module, and then import only the functions or classes that you need. This approach makes your code more modular and reusable, and also simplifies testing and debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical workflow is to write and test code in a Jupyter notebook, then copy the finalized code into a Python file, and run that Python file in the terminal. This process allows you to iteratively develop and test code in the notebook environment, and then verify its correctness when run as a standalone script.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** If you're importing a function from a subfolder (package), make sure to include an `__init__.py` file in that subfolder. This file can be empty, but it is required to tell Python that the subfolder is a package and enables imports from that directory.\n",

    "I mainly use Visual Studio Code for my Python development, so here are some useful plugins that can enhance your Python development experience:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Python**\n",
    "    - The official Python extension for Visual Studio Code. It provides features such as IntelliSense (code completion), linting, debugging, code navigation, code formatting, and unit testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Jupyter**\n",
    "    - An extension for working with Jupyter notebooks directly in Visual Studio Code. It supports interactive notebooks with features like IntelliSense, code formatting, debugging, and visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Rainbow Indent**\n",
    "    - This extension colorizes code indentation levels, making it easier to see code structure and improving readability—especially in deeply nested code.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Data Wrangler**\n",
    "    - A powerful extension for working with data. It supports data visualization, data exploration, data cleaning, and transformation—all within Visual Studio Code.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "You can install these plugins by searching for them in the Visual Studio Code Marketplace.  \n",
    "Alternatively, use the terminal with the `code` command:\n",

    "## Markdown\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain-text-formatting syntax. Its design allows it to be converted to many output formats, but the original tool by the same name only supports HTML. Markdown is often used to format README files, write messages in online discussion forums, and create rich text using a plain text editor.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use Markdown to format text, add images, create lists, and add links. Markdown supports creating headings, paragraphs, blockquotes, code blocks, tables, lists, and task lists. It also allows for footnotes, definition lists, and abbreviations (with some implementations).\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown is built directly into Jupyter notebooks, so you can use it to format your text, create headings, paragraphs, lists, and links, and also to add tables, images, and code blocks—all within your notebook cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also add LaTeX equations to your Jupyter notebooks using Markdown. LaTeX can be used to create mathematical equations, symbols, fractions, integrals, matrices, Greek letters, arrows, and other advanced mathematical expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Here's an example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```markdown\n",
